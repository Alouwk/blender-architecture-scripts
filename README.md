Blender architecture scripts
============================

This repo contains a collection of Blender scripts and plugins specially useful for architecture. 
This repo serves these main purposes:

1. Make it easy to find all these scripts which are usually spread into different places (eg. dropbox folders, authors' blogs, blender wiki...) and thus difficult to find.
2. Provide a backup or a time-proof repository which don't rely on 3rd pary (I've been always concerned that those scripts could be lost sometime).
3. Benefit from Git and github's social features in order to make it easier to collaborate and improve plugins.


Please note that this doesn't mean that all these addons and scripts are necesarilly going to be mantained. This responsability, as well as their credits relies on each script's authors and mantainers.

[Visit this wiki page](https://github.com/ccamara/blender-architecture-scripts/wiki/List-of-available-addons) to see all the information regarding to the addons that have been included on this repo.
