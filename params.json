Make it easy to find all these scripts which are usually spread into different places (eg. dropbox folders, authors' blogs, blender wiki...) and thus difficult to find.\r\n2. Provide a backup or a time-proof repository which don't rely on 3rd pary (I've been always concerned that those scripts could be lost sometime).\r\n3. Benefit from Git and github's social features in order to make it easier to collaborate and improve plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that this doesn't mean that all these addons and scripts are necesarilly going to be mantained. This responsability, as well as their credits relies on each script's authors and mantainers.\r\n\r\n[Visit this wiki page](https://github.com/ccamara/blender-architecture-scripts/wiki/List-of-available-addons) to see all the information regarding to the addons that have been included on this repo.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nWe provide two different ways to use this repo: basic usage (no git knowledge required) and advanced usage for those who want to benefit from all git's features such as cloning, forking, contributing, updating...\r\n\r\n###Basic usage\r\n\r\n1. Download this repo's content from the [download link](https://github.com/ccamara/blender-architecture-scripts/archive/master.zip)\r\n2. Extract it into your blender's scripts' folder (this may be different depending on your operating system, so if in doubt, please check [this page](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/Python/Add-Ons) to know where should you place them)\r\n3. Enable the desired plugin from Blender's properties' dialog box.\r\n\r\n###Advanced usage\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to your blender's scripts' folder\r\n2. Clone this repo using the following command: ```git clone git@github.com:ccamara/blender-architecture-scripts.git```\r\n3. In case you want to update your local code from the latest code from this repo you have to execute the following commands \r\n4. `git pull` to retrieve all the files (Except all the files cloned from other repositories.\r\n4. Since this repo uses gitsubmodules you'll have to perform some extra commands: `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`\r\n\r\n##More information/help\r\nIf you have doubts you can always read the [repo's wiki page](https://github.com/ccamara/blender-architecture-scripts/wiki) or check our [issue queue](https://github.com/ccamara/blender-architecture-scripts/issues)\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
